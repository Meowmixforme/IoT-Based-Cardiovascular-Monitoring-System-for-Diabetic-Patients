## Overview
An intelligent IoT solution that provides continuous cardiovascular monitoring for diabetic patients through non-invasive sensors. The system combines hardware sensors, real-time data processing, and machine learning analytics to detect anomalies and track vital sign trends.

## Key Features
- Multi-sensor integration (ECG, Temperature, Heart Rate, SpO2)
- Real-time vital signs monitoring and visualisation
- Machine Learning-powered analysis:
  - Anomaly detection using Isolation Forest
  - Trend analysis with Exponential Smoothing
  - Health state classification using Random Forest
- Secure data storage with MongoDB
- Interactive web dashboard built with Streamlit
